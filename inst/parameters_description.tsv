parameter	default_value	description
		
max_split_over_minor	0.5	For every combination of two pixels on the boundary, Cell-ID calculates the distance along the boundary path divided by the Euclidean distance between them. The maximum value of this ratio is larger for cells with a “figure-eight” shape that were pinched in some part than for circular cells. If the maximum value is above a user-defined threshold (which defaults to max_dist_over_waist=6), then the cell is split into two cells at the location of the pinch. After a split, if the Euclidean distance divided by the length of the minor axis of either of the new cells is greater than a user-defined value (which defaults to max_split_over_minor=0.5), then the two cells are re-grouped as a single cell. Thus, to perform the split we require that the two new cells have a generally circular shape and are not too elongated, as would be the case if the previous split was not over two cells, but over a cell and its mating projection.
		
max_dist_over_waist	8	For every combination of two pixels on the boundary, Cell-ID calculates the distance along the boundary path divided by the Euclidean distance between them. The maximum value of this ratio is larger for cells with a “figure-eight” shape that were pinched in some part than for circular cells. If the maximum value is above a user-defined threshold (which defaults to max_dist_over_waist=6), then the cell is split into two cells at the location of the pinch. After a split, if the Euclidean distance divided by the length of the minor axis of either of the new cells is greater than a user-defined value (which defaults to max_split_over_minor=0.5), then the two cells are re-grouped as a single cell. Thus, to perform the split we require that the two new cells have a generally circular shape and are not too elongated, as would be the case if the previous split was not over two cells, but over a cell and its mating projection.
		
max_pixels_per_cell	3000	Area limits per cell (upper bound). These are the lower and upper boundaries for the size of a cell, in number of pixels. This parameter is useful for limiting the number of spurious cells (false positives) identified by Cell-ID. The actual number depends on the magnification of the objective and the size of pixels in the chip of the CCD camera. For example, in images taken with an oil-immersion 60× objective on a CCD camera with 13-µm pixels, exponentially growing yeast have an average area of 400 pixels, and limits between 200 and 600 work well to include all cells.
		
min_pixels_per_cell	70	Area limits per cell (lower bound). These are the lower and upper boundaries for the size of a cell, in number of pixels. This parameter is useful for limiting the number of spurious cells (false positives) identified by Cell-ID. The actual number depends on the magnification of the objective and the size of pixels in the chip of the CCD camera. For example, in images taken with an oil-immersion 60× objective on a CCD camera with 13-µm pixels, exponentially growing yeast have an average area of 400 pixels, and limits between 200 and 600 work well to include all cells.
		
background_reject_factor	1.5	"Cell-ID's segmentation algorithm makes an initial decision about the intensity of the boundary pixels. To do this, it takes the mean pixel intensity of the BF image, and subtracts the result of multiplying the images standard deviation by the ""background reject factor"" parameter. Cell-ID then starts by considering all intensities below this value as  being parts of the cell borders (i.e. black halos in the BF images). Usual values are between 0.4 and 1.2.BF images taken slightly out of focus may be better defined with higher values (i.e., higher values will better avoid spurious cells), but if the cell boundaries in the image are too narrow, a smaller value may be necessary, which might have the consequence of increasing the number of incorrectly segmented cells."
		
treat_brightfield_as_fluorescence_also	FALSE	Calculate all the fluorescence images variables on the bright field image as if it were a fluorescence image. This is potentially a good idea since it allows a good way to reject spurious cells. For example, the average value of the boundary pixels in good cells will be lower than the background level, but not so for spurious cells, etc.
		
image_type brightfield	FALSE	Image type of the image that is used to find the cells.
		
bf_fl_mapping	list	"Possible values: ""list"", ""time"". ""bf_fl_mapping"" option description (guessed from code, mask_mod branch). The mapping between brightfield and fluorescence images can be made by acquisition time, or derived from the order in the list of paths passed as command line options ""-b"" and ""-f"" to cell. If the order is by ""list"", then the paths must be grouped and ordered first by t.frame (ascending) and then by channel. If the order is by ""time"", cell derives the BF-FL mapping from the acquisition time in the TIFF metadata."
		
fret	FALSE	"Possible values: FALSE (omit), ""bf_top_only"", ""bf_bottom_only"", ""bf_bottom_and_top"". If we have a ""fret"" image or not (a ""fret"" image here means that the image is split into an upper and lower half, each with its own excitation filter in front of it). The three arguments (bf_top_only, bf_bottom_only, bf_bottom_and_top) indicate where in the bright field image to look for the cells--since it's assumed that the bright field image also had its output sent throught the two excitation filters."
		
fret	FALSE	"Possible values: FALSE (omit), ""nuclear_top"", ""nuclear_bottom"". More for the fret images. One of the fluorescence images will be used to identify the nucleus. Should it be the top or bottom image."
		
third_image	FALSE	"Possible values: FALSE (omit), ""vacuole_label"", ""nuclear_label"". If there is a third image type included, then this describes how to use it (nuclear_label means its a fluorescence tagged nucleus channel, vacuole_label means vacuole label)"
		
do_recombination	FALSE	"Do recombination to try to connect cells using cuts on fluorescence ""recombination_fl_per_a_nucleus F CUT"" is cut below which we consider the cell has no nucleus. ""F"" is the ""flag"" given to the fluorescence type we're going to use for the cut. ""recombination_is_a_cell_fl_per_a F CUT"" is minimum fluorescence/area to consider the cell a real cell (a way to get rid of junk). This is only used for recombining cells. Ie, for recombining cells we only consider cells above CUT but we don't throw away those that fail. ""F"" is the flag for the fluorescence type to use."
		
recombination_fl_per_a_nucleus	1 2500.0	"Tuning parameter for ""do_recombination"". Note that the option requires two values. ""do_recombination"" to try to connect cells using cuts on fluorescence ""recombination_fl_per_a_nucleus F CUT"" is cut below which we consider the cell has no nucleus. ""F"" is the ""flag"" given to the fluorescence type we're going to use for the cut. ""recombination_is_a_cell_fl_per_a F CUT"" is minimum fluorescence/area to consider the cell a real cell (a way to get rid of junk). This is only used for recombining cells. Ie, for recombining cells we only consider cells above CUT but we don't throw away those that fail. ""F"" is the flag for the fluorescence type to use."
		
recombination_is_a_cell_fl_per_a	3 500.0	"Tuning parameter for ""do_recombination"". Note that the option requires two values. ""do_recombination"" to try to connect cells using cuts on fluorescence ""recombination_fl_per_a_nucleus F CUT"" is cut below which we consider the cell has no nucleus. ""F"" is the ""flag"" given to the fluorescence type we're going to use for the cut. ""recombination_is_a_cell_fl_per_a F CUT"" is minimum fluorescence/area to consider the cell a real cell (a way to get rid of junk). This is only used for recombining cells. Ie, for recombining cells we only consider cells above CUT but we don't throw away those that fail. ""F"" is the flag for the fluorescence type to use."
		
align_individual_cells	FALSE	"Allow wiggling between the brightfield and fluorescence images. If ""align individual cells"" is selected, Cell-ID will move the contour of each cell found on the BF image to match the cells in the fluorescence images. This feature is useful when cells are not affixed and move slightly between image acquisitions. This option significantly increases the execution time of Cell-ID and should not be used if the cells are affixed."
		
align_individual_cells_boundary		Missing description.
		
append_output	FALSE	Possible values: FALSE (omit), 1000 (any positive integer). append_output means that when we write out the output files we're going to _add_ to the end of the files instead of making new ones. the argument is the offset to add to the id numbers.
		
tracking_comparison	0.2	"Cell-ID attempts to track cells over time. The value of this parameter is the minimal fractional overlap between two cells in consecutive time points for them to be considered the same cell. The default value is 0.2. Also named ""I_over_U_for_match"" in CellID's cell.c and segment.c files."
		
align_fl_to_bf	TRUE	"Frame alignment across time-frames. Cell-ID can perform image registrations, moving the frame in the X-Y plane to align it to a reference image. If ""align FL to BF"" is selected, the BF image is used as reference. If ""align FL to first"" is selected, the first fluorescence image is used as reference. These options are especially useful when sampling different positions, as repositioning of the microscope stage might introduce displacement between consecutive images."
		
align_fl_to_first	FALSE	Frame alignment. Cell-ID can perform image registrations, moving the the frame in XY to align it to a reference image. If “align FL to BF” is selected the bright field image is used as reference. If “align FL to first” is selected the first fluorescence image is used as reference. These options are especially useful when sampling different positions, as repositioning of the microscope stage might introduce some displacement between consecutive images.
		
force_nucleus_in_center		Missing description.
		
output_individual_cells		(not tested) Probably means that output images will contain one cell each, and many images sets will be generated.
		
image_type		Missing description.
