# Introduction

This notebook contains a minimal [Example workflow], 
with a broad overview of the pipeline.

There is another notebook bundled with the package, 
with in-depth explanations and advanced usage examples.
See [Full guide] below.

## Friendly reminder

- **Read this notebook carefully**.
- Use the **help page** of functions before using them. Open help pages with R's `?` (e.g. `?arguments`).
- Read the README.md at rcell2's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2/).

## Example workflow

This is only meant as a quick example.

For full usage details, skip to the [Usage guide] section of this notebook, 
and read it carefully.

Always read the `?help` before using a function ;) specially when they do file operations,
which are irreversible.

This example uses:

* Image examples from the `rcell2.examples` package.
* Images and filenames in time-course experiment "format": `BF_Position001_time01.tif`
* Default CellID segmentation parameters.
* The built-in CellID binary.

### Images directory

First point R to the folder containing the images. This notebook obeys the path
specified in the `data.dir` variable. Make sure to assign its value once, or 
double-check before overwriting it.

In this example we install and use a set from the "examples" package. A more
detailed explanation is available in the [Path to the dataset] section of
this notebook.

```{r}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")){
  # Install the "remotes" package if not found:
  install.packages("remotes")
}

if(!requireNamespace("rcell2.examples")){
  # Install the "rcell2.examples" package if not found:
  remotes::install_github("darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2.examples")
}

# Example: Choose one set of example images:
data.dir <- system.file("extdata/sample_datasets/sample_time_series/",
                        package = "rcell2.examples")
# List image files in the set:
dir(data.dir)
```

### Naming images for Cell-ID

Images output by the acquisition software may result in file
names different from the default style (i.e `YFP_Position01_time1.tif`, and so on).
The default pattern is described at the [Image file names] section of this notebook.

The `rename_mda` function will help you rename file names to match that pattern.
The function is provided by the `rcell2.cellid` package. A full example on how to
use it is available below, in the [Renaming images] section of this notebook.

### Run Cell-ID

1. Customize parameters for CellID.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameters with default values.
parameters.list <- rcell2.cellid::parameters_default()

# Write the parameters to a plain-text file, and save its path.
parameters.txt <- rcell2.cellid::parameters_write(parameters.list)
```

> Note: segmentation parameters for Cell-ID and criteria to customize them
> are discussed in the [Parameters] section of this notebook.

2. Prepare the "arguments" dataframe for CellID, which lists the image files that match
   the regular expression specified in `file.pattern`.

```{r}
# Gather images
cellid.args <- 
  rcell2.cellid::arguments(path = data.dir, 
                           parameters = parameters.txt)
```

> Note: the default file pattern will match file names that match de default pattern
> (described in the [Image file names] section). Alternative patterns are discussed
> in the [Arguments] section.

3. Run Cell-ID with the built-in executable:

```{r eval=F}
cell2.out <- 
  rcell2.cellid::cell2(arguments = cellid.args,
                       # progress = T,  # Progress bar (requires doSnow).
                       # cell.command = "~/Software/cellID-linux/cell",  # You may use an external executable.
                       output_coords_to_tsv = T  # Optional! Only works with newer CellID (>= 1.5).
                       )
```

The returned dataframe contains the following information:

- The return status of each Cell-ID process (zero if successful).
- The shell command used to run each Cell-ID process (can be used outside R).
- Paths to log files with information about the execution.

```{r eval=F}
# Check the output messages:
cell2.out
```

> Note: we suggest that you check your images before segmentation, as shown in the
> [Preview images in ImageJ] section. It may be critical to optimize parameters on a subset of 
> images, before processing the whole experiment, as shown in the [Tuning parameters] 
> section.

### Load the output

The output tables can be loaded with `get_cell_data` provided by this package.

```{r eval=F}
# Load output
cell.data <- get_cell_data(path = data.dir)
```

> Note: detailed usage of this function is described at the [Output data] section of this
> notebook.

`rcell2.cellid` can also load the cell boundaries and interior pixels coordinates,
if either `output_coords_to_tsv` or `encode_cellID_in_pixels` were set to `TRUE`
when Cell-ID was run.

To load the boundary pixels, use the `cell.load.boundaries`:

```{r eval=F}
# Useful if either "output_coords_to_tsv" or "encode_cellID_in_pixels" were TRUE in cell().
cell.boundaries <- 
  cell.load.boundaries(data_source = "masks.tsv",
                       data = cell.data$positions,
                       pixel.type = "b")
```

> This data is only available if `cell2` was run with `output_coords_to_tsv = T`.

> Note: `rcell2` provides the `load_cell_data` and `cell.load.boundaries` functions,
> to load the measurements and cell boundary pixels, respectively.

### Understanding the data

Access the main output data and plot:

```{r}
cdata <- cell.data$data

cdata %>% ggplot(aes(a.tot, fft.stat)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_grid(t.frame~pos)
```

> Note: the "c" in "cdata" stands for _cell_ data.

Output variables are described by this documentation function:

```{r}
rcell2.cellid::output_help_df
```

Plot cell boundaries:

```{r}
cell.boundaries %>% 
  group_by(pos) %>% filter(cellID == 0) %>% 
  filter(pixtype == "b") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y,color=factor(t.frame)))+
  geom_path()+
  facet_wrap(~pos, scales = "free") + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

> This data is only available if `cell2` has been run with `output_coords_to_tsv = T`.

### Load position metadata

This step is optional, but also part of our usual workflow.

The `pdata` CSV file holds information about how the cells
of each position (and time) were prepared and treated.

Get the path to the file:

```{r}
# pdata_path <- "path/to/your/pdata.csv"
pdata_path <- dir(data.dir, "pdata.csv", full.names = T)  # Sample pdata

pdata_path
```

Load "pdata":

```{r}
# It is a "metadata" dataframe we usually join to cdata by "position" and/or "t.frame",
# which contains other experimental variables: simuli concentrations, notes, etc.
pdata <- readr::read_csv(pdata_path)

pdata
```

> Note: the "p" in "pdata" stands for microscope _position_ data.

This table is usually joined to cdata by position (and time frame if available).

> Warning: `load_cell_data` does the following automatically if a pdata.csv file is found next to the images.
> If it were the case, you shouldn't run the join again.

```{r eval=F}
cdata <- left_join(cdata, pdata)
```

### Save and restore progress

We recommend saving the current state at this point.

```{r eval=F}
# Save all variables to a Rdata file.
save.image("01-segmentation_results.Rdata")
```

The workspace image may be restored later on:

```{r eval=F}
# Restore all variables from the Rdata file.
load("01-segmentation_results.Rdata")
```

# Advanced tools

## Full guide

There is also full usage guide in a separate notebook, which you can open by running:

```{r}
rcell2.cellid::get_workflow_template_cellid()
```

## Cell Magick

You may want to check out the Shiny/Magick rcell2 analisys package!

It provides functions to manipulate images of single cells into strips, mosaics,
and plots. It has it's own notebook with full examples and explanations.

Execute the following to install the package.

```{r eval=F}
if(!requireNamespace("rcell2.magick")) remotes::install_github("darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2-magick")
```

Run the following to open package's notebook:

```{r}
rcell2.magick::get_workflow_template_magick()
```

Alternatively, run the following line-by-line, to preview its features.

```{r eval=F}
# Images data.frame
images <- cell.data$images

# Pics
cdata %>% filter(fft.stat < 0.3, el.p > 0.8) %>% 
  rcell2.magick::magickCell(images)

# Plot
rcell2.magick::cellSpreadPlot(cdata, images)

# App
rcell2.magick::shinyCell(cdata, paths = images)
```
